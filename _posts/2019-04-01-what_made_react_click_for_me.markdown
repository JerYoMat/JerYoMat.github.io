Initially, I struggled with React.  The declarative approach along with class components just didn't make sense.  Now, I love React.  Here is how I learned the essentials.  
 
**1.) Make sure your Javascript is solid before starting React**
React components are not that different from regular Javascript functions.  If you aren't comfortable passing around functions as values and dealing with objects, you will struggle.  A great way to see where you stand is to read Chapter 6 of Eloquent Javascript(https://eloquentjavascript.net/).  If you read that chapter and spend a good portion saying something along the lines of "WTF!" in your head, then read the book.  It did wonders for me.  

**2.) Do lots of guided practice**
Playing in the sandbox on your own is great, however, if you don't see the right way to do something, then chances are your code will not conform to what people are used to seeing and you won't learn all that much.

The most helpful sources I've found for the last flatiron course unit were Pure-React and Pure-Redux by Dave Ceddia(https://daveceddia.podia.com/).  What I really like about these videos/books is:
*  You start out with simple, functional components that look precisely like Javascript functions and build up slowly from there. 
* 1. Tons of small code-along examples that show you how to handle a ton of real-world problems.
* 1. The time requirement is not immense.  If you spend a few hours on this stuff, you will see marked improvement.
