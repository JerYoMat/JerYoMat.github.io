I never thought that I would get much use out of learning how to do journal entries and never liked doing them.  However, once I started similarly thinking of Redux, the whole thing made a lot more sense.  
Redux a state management tool, and tracks state by dispatching actions that are matched within a reducer and return the new state.  Likewise, with journal entries, each event is recorded which adjusts the various balances within the general ledger.  While ticking most of us off by having to file expense reports etc., these entries enable the bean counters to walk back in time to see what a balance was at a previous date.   Redux is the same way.  
 You don't have to like accounting, but if you are having trouble getting your head around redux but were forced to eat your dog food in college, this might help you out.
