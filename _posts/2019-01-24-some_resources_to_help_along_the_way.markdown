As we all know, learning to code is hard and takes ample practice.  While completing the lessons I’m always on the lookout for additional practice and have really benefited from taking the time to work through the following resources. 

**Jump Start Sinatra by Darren Jones **

*Description: *
A short book that provides a practical introduction to Sinatra by building out an simple app called Songs by Sinatra.  

*What I got out of it:*
After completing the Sinatra lessons, this book was a great review that also gave me an opportunity to practice coding while providing clear explanations for each step.  If you feel like you could use a refresher and have a few hours to spare then I recommend that you work your way through chapters 2, 3, and 5.
*Approximate Time Requirement:* 3 – 5 hours 

**Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl **

*Description: *
A free tutorial to get you up and running with rails.  The book is broken out into three parts each of which walks you through building an application.   

*What I got out of it:*
The book provides an in-depth explanation on how to build out robust workflows for creating, signing in and remembering users which is super helpful when it came to my rails project.   In addition the book shows you how to write tests for each step and builds out an awesome stylesheet that is a great base for your own project that you can customize.  After completing the course material I recommend reading chapters 3-10 and 13.  
*Approximate Time Requirement:* 7-10 hours


**JavaScript & Jquery: The Missing Manual by David Sawyer MacFarland **

*Description: *
A giant collection of examples for using JavaScript and Jquery.  

*What I got out of it:*
After Rails I had trouble getting the hang of JavaScript and JQuery. The practice files that come with this book(or can just be downloaded) were a great place to practice manipulating the DOM.  
*Approximate Time Requirement:*  Whatever you want
